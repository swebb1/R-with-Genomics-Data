**ggplot2** is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a grammar for specifying which variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes to our code if the underlying data change or if we decide to switch from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps to create publication quality plots with minimal adjustments and tweaking.

First, make sure you load all of the required libraries and datasets. There are quite a few new libraries here and we will explain them as we go.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggpubr)
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggsci)
library(patchwork)
library(gghighlight)

#This dataset is built in to R
data(iris)
#Import from the web
surveys <- read_csv("http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/training/R_dplyr_and_ggplot2/data/surveys_complete.csv") 
```

<br>

## Fisher's Iris dataset (pre-installed in R)
***

![](images/iris.png)

<br>

Fisher examined the length and width of the petals and sepals in irises to determine a classification algorithm. Here we will explore the relationship between species and the dimension of the flowers via the ggplot2 plotting package. Fisher's data is stored as a built in data set in R. To see the data type:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

This data frame has two types of data, continuous and discrete.
 
```{r}
str(iris)
```

The continuous data is of type number and the discrete data is of type factor, which can be one of the 3 species:

```{r}
levels(iris$Species)
```

The `summary()` function gives a summary of data in a column. For factors it will give us the count for each categorical variable.

```{r}
summary(iris$Species)
```

We can also use run `summary()` on an entire dataframe or tibble. Take a look at the different column types.

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

<br>

## Building a ggplot
***

ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding *layers* in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots. To build a ggplot, we use the following basic template:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

Let's explore the iris dataset with ggplot. Use the ggplot() function and bind the plot to a specific dataframe using the data argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris)
```

Define a mapping (using the aesthetic (aes) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

To plot our data we need to add a geometry. Geoms are the graphical representations of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms, here are a few commonly used examples:

* `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
* `geom_histogram()` for histograms
* `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()` for bar plots
* `geom_boxplot()` for, well, boxplots!
* `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.

<br>

## Scatterplots
***

To add a geom to the plot use the + operator. Letâ€™s use geom_point() to plot two continuous variables first. The *data* and *mapping* are always the first two arguments to ggplot so we can leave these out if arguments are provided in this order:

```{r}
ggplot(iris,aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```

The `+` in the ggplot2 package is particularly useful because it allows us to modify existing ggplot objects. This means we can easily set up plot templates and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot can also be generated with code like this:

```{r}
# Assign plot to a variable
p <- ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))

# Draw a scatter plot
p + geom_point()
```

Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function is inherited by the subsequent geom layers that you add. This includes the x- and y-axis mapping you set up in `aes()`. If you want to specify mappings for a given geom independently you can add these within a geom.

We can colour the points in the geometry.
```{r}
p + geom_point(colour="red")
```

Not very informative though, let's start again and colour the points by species. Note as well that the x and y labels are also not neccessary if the data is in the correct order.

```{r}
p<-ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, colour=Species) ) +  geom_point()
p
```

In the `aes()` function, `colour` is used for lines and points. If you want to colour shapes such as bars in barplots and histograms you need to use `fill`.

Each function within the ggplot package has its own help file associated with it.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?geom_point()
```

Note that all the geometries also define a statistical transformation. In the help file of geom_point you'll see that `stat = "identity"` which is just the value that is presented. Other geometries have different defaults, for instance `geom_histogram` bins values together.

<br>

## Histograms
***

Here is an example of the histogram geometry:

```{r}
#Create a new version of the iris dataset with a new column
iris2<- iris %>% mutate(Sepal.Ratio=Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
#Visualise the distribution of Sepal.Ratio with a histogram
h<- ggplot(iris2, aes(Sepal.Ratio, fill=Species )) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.1)
h
```

<br>
<div class="discussion">
<h2><i class="far fa-bell"></i> Discussion</h2>

```{r,  purl=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width )) + geom_point() 
```
</div>
</details>
</div>
<br>

## Boxplots
***

Boxplots are an effective way to visualise distributions of data within groups. The boxplot geometry needs the x value to be a categorical variable. 

```{r}
b <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width )) +  geom_boxplot() 
b
```

To change the axes we can use another function called coord_flip()

```{r}
b + coord_flip()
```

We can reorder the `Species` by the median `Sepal.Width` for display purposes. The **forcats** package in the **tidyverse** has lots of functions for ordering, labelling and manipulating factors (discrete / categorical variables).

```{r}
b <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=fct_reorder(Species,Sepal.Width), y=Sepal.Width )) + 
  geom_boxplot()
b
```

We probably want to relabel the x-axis now:

```{r}
b <- b + xlab("Species")
b
```

What if we want to plot all of the variables per species as a boxplot? We can add multiple boxplot geoms to a plot but it doesn't really work as an informative graphic:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length))
```

The problem is that our different variables (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width etc.) exist in different columns. There is no way to separate these along the x-axis or to colour them differently. 

Our data is currently in "wide" format and each row represents an observation for one flower. We need to transform the data into "long" format so that each column header becomes a value. We can use the `pivot_longer()` function in **tidyr** to do this.

```{r}
#We use "-Species" as we want to pivot all of the columns except Species. We move the column names to a new variable called flower part and the values to a column called Value. 
iris.long <- iris %>% pivot_longer(-Species, names_to = "Flower.Part", values_to = "Value")
head(iris.long)
```

Now it is easy to create the boxplot we wanted. 

```{r} 
ggplot(iris.long, aes(Species, Value, fill=Flower.Part)) + geom_boxplot()
```

<br>

## Adding layers
***

By adding points to a boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of measurements and of their distribution.  
 
```{r}
b + geom_point(colour="forest green")
```

This is okay, but there are some blurry dots where values overlap and it's difficult to see how many data points we really have. We can use the `alpha` option within our geometry to increase transparency.

```{r}
b + geom_point(colour="forest green",alpha=0.3)
```

This is slightly better, we can see that darker points have more overlap, but it isn't great. `geom_jitter` is a good alternative to `geom_point` in this example as it shifts data points so that they don't overlap. We will colour by Species so there is no confusion.

```{r}
b + geom_jitter(aes(colour=Species))
```

<br>

## Violin plots
***

<div class="challenge">
<h2><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> Challenge:</h2>
Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For
example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a
boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape 
of the density of points is drawn.

Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see `geom_violin()`.

<br>

## Themes
***

Recap: 
```{r}
p<-ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, colour=Species)) +  geom_point()
```

We can continue to modify this scatter plot. Let's make the axis a bit prettier with the xlab() and ylab() functions: 

```{r, error=T}
p <- p + xlab('Sepal length') + ylab('Sepal width') 
p
```

All the characteristics of the plot, such as text size and the background are managed by the function called theme(). To see what a theme can change: 
```{r}
?theme
```

You can use a theme with predefined defaults e.g:

```{r}
p + theme_dark() #Dark theme
#OR
p + theme_bw() #Black and white theme
```

You can also try `theme_light`, `theme_minimal`, `theme_void`, or create you own from scratch:

```{r}
p + theme(
    		panel.background = element_blank(), 
     		panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "darkgrey"), 
     		text = element_text(size=20), 
     		axis.title.x=element_blank(), 
     		axis.title.y=element_blank()
    		)
# Note you can save your theme and reuse it 
theme_for_nature <- theme(
    		panel.background = element_blank(), 
     		panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "darkgrey"), 
     		text = element_text(size=20), 
     		axis.title.x=element_blank(), 
     		axis.title.y=element_blank() 
    		)
```

We can then reuse a theme, for example on the histogram we made earlier.
```{r}
h + theme_for_nature
```

R-studio will offer help finding themes after typing "theme_". Give some of them a try. The **ggthemes** and **ggpubr** packages also contain a selection of prebuilt themes e.g:

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
p + theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

We can set a default theme to use in all ggplots: 
```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

```{r,echo=F}
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=18))
```

<br>

## Adding colours to plots
***

As we have seen, points, lines and shapes can be coloured by a value in your dataframe using the `aes()` function. Earlier we coloured by a factor but we can also colour by a continuous value which will create a gradient of colour. Lets look at the Petals this time and colour by the ratio of Sepal.Length to Sepal.Width:

```{r}
q <- ggplot(iris2, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)
q
```

To change the colours we need to use the `scale_color_*` functions of which there are many. Some are built into **ggplot2** and others exist in external packages such as **viridis** or **ggthemes**. The [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) and [ColorBrewer](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/the-a-z-of-rcolorbrewer-palette/) palettes are particularly useful and worth investigating. The [ggsci](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html) package contains palletes based on key scientific journals.

<br>

### **Continuous scales**

Try the different scale options in the code below:

```{r}
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
#default
q + scale_colour_continuous()
#ColorBrewer palletes (many to choose from)
q + scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
#Viridis colour scales (many to choose from)
q + scale_colour_viridis()
```

An alternative method is to use the `scale_colour_gradient*` functions to define your own gradient e.g:

```{r}
q + scale_color_gradient2(high="darkred", low="white",  mid="red", midpoint=2)
```

<br>

### **Discrete scales**

There are also colour scales for discrete variables. Note that we must use `fill` for colouring boxes.

```{r}
bp<- ggplot(iris2,aes(Species,Sepal.Length,fill=Species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
#Default
bp + scale_fill_discrete()
#Viridis
bp + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
#ColorBrewer Palettes
bp + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
#GGSci - Nature publishing group
library(ggsci)
bp + scale_fill_npg()
```

Alternatively you can manually choose your own colours:

```{r}
h + scale_fill_manual(values = c("forest green","dodger blue", "firebrick"))
```

<br>
<div class="resources">
<h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Further Learning</h2>
The options for colouring graphs are huge.

* [Color brewer 2](http://colorbrewer2.org) is a great site for getting the hex values of colours to suit needs such as printer or colour blind friendliness.
* [Coolors](http://coolors.co) and [Colormind](colormind.io) are colour palette generators.
</div>
<br>

## Adding more variables
***

Take a look at this example:
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(iris2, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>
<div class="challenge">
<h2><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> Challenge:</h2>
See if you can represent some of the other variables from the iris dataset in this plot as well. **Hint:** There are several other aesthetic mappings such as `size` and `shape`.
<details>
<summary></summary>
<div class="solution">
<h2><i class="far fa-eye"></i> Solution:</h2>
```{r,  purl=FALSE}
ggplot(iris2, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Sepal.Ratio, shape=Species,size=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)
```
</div>
</details>
</div>
<br>

## Faceting
***

When we have defined groups within a dataset, we can split our data into separate plots by using `facets`. 

Let's look at plot q again 
```{r}
q
```

Let's split this plot by species. This is achieved using either the `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` functions:

```{r}
q + facet_wrap(~Species,nrow = 1,scales = "fixed")
```

Note that the facet variable is preceded by the ~ character. This is used to define formulas in R. Try playing around with the `nrow` and `scales` parameters in `facet_wrap()`.

The `facet_grid()` function is useful when you are splitting by multiple factors. For instance, let's add a country column to `iris2` by randomly assigning one of four nations of origin to each observation:

```{r}
countries <- c("Italy", "Spain", "France", "UK")
#Sample will randomly select a value for each row
iris2 <- iris2 %>% mutate(Country=sample(countries,nrow(iris2),replace=TRUE))

q2 <- ggplot(iris2, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, colour = Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point()
q2 + facet_grid(Country ~ Species)
```

<br>
<div class="challenge">
<h2><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> Challenge:</h2>
Use dplyr and ggplot to display the mean petal length for each species in each country except for those found in France. Use colouring and faceting to enhance the plot.
<details>
<summary></summary>
<div class="solution">
<h2><i class="far fa-eye"></i> Solution:</h2>
```{r,  purl=FALSE}
iris2 %>% 
filter(Country != "France") %>% 
group_by(Species,Country) %>% 
summarise(Mean=mean(Petal.Length)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=Country, y=Mean, colour=Species)) + geom_point(size=4) + facet_wrap(~Species) + labs(title="Mean Petal Length")
```
</div>
</details>
</div>
<br>

## Saving plots
***

In RStudio there are many options to save the image. However, if you are are wanting to use ggplot2 in a script, or via web interfaces, you can export a graph using the function `ggsave()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#save a png file 
ggsave("IrisScatterplot.png", p)
#save a pdf file
ggsave("IrisScatterplot.pdf", p)
```

The image format is automatically assigned from the file extension you use in the filename. Within `ggsave()` you can also set the resolution for the image as well as the length and width for the image. See the help page for ggsave for more options.

<br>

## Arranging multiple plots
***

Placing ggplots side by side can be performed with packages like **gridExtra** and **patchwork**. [Patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) uses simple formulas to arrange ggplots:

```{r,fig.width=8}
library(patchwork)
#On top
q/bp
#Side by side
q+bp
#2 plots on top, 1 on bottom
(q+h)/bp
#Collect the guides together on one side
(q+h)/bp + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
```

To save:
```{r, eval=F}
#On top
ggsave("DoublePlot.png",q/bp)
```

<br>

## More useful functions to try
***

### **Cut functions**

The `cut_*` functions in ggplot2 can turn continous data into discrete levels. In this example we create a new column that puts the data into 5 groups of equal size based on `Sepal.Length`:

```{r}
iris2 <- iris2 %>% mutate(Sepal.Length.Group=cut_number(Sepal.Length,5))

ggplot(iris2,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,fill = Sepal.Length.Group)) +  
  geom_violin() +
  labs(fill="Sepal length intervals", x="Sepal length",y="Sepal width")
```

Note the use of the `labs()` function to change multiple labels at once.

Have a look at the difference between the `cut_number`, `cut_interval` and `cut_width` functions.

<br>

### **Scaling data**

Let's look at a larger dataset like the `surveys_complete` data we used earlier:

```{r}
ggplot(surveys,aes(weight,hindfoot_length))+geom_point()
```

For axes with large values or very dispersed values it can be useful to rescale using a log axis. This can be done in two ways:

```{r}
#We can transform the values in our ggplot call:
ggplot(surveys,aes(log10(weight),hindfoot_length))+geom_point()
```

```{r}
#OR we can change the axis to a log scale
ggplot(surveys,aes(weight,hindfoot_length))+geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

<br>
<div class="discussion">
<h2><i class="far fa-bell"></i> Discussion</h2>
What is the difference between these two plots?</div>
<br>

### **Adding labels**

You can add labels to points in your graphs. One of the best ways to do this is to use the package **ggrepel**.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
# you can use geom_text_repel() or geom_label_repel() to label whatever you want with non-overlapping labels. In the brackets use conditional subsetting to only label the interesting elements of your data.

ggplot(iris2,aes(Petal.Width,Petal.Length,colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label=ifelse(Petal.Length > 6.4 ,as.character(Species),'')))
```

### **Highlight points or lines**

You can choose to highlight specific points or lines using **gghighlight**:

```{r}
library(gghighlight)
ggplot(iris2,aes(Petal.Width,Petal.Length,colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  gghighlight(Petal.Length > 6.4,label_key = Species)
```


<br>

### **Interactive graphs with Plotly**

[Plotly](https://plot.ly/ggplot2) for ggplot2 is a browser-based charting library that converts ggplots into interactive visualisations:

```{r}
library(plotly)
p2<-ggplot(iris2,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,colour=Species))+geom_point()
gp2<-ggplotly(p2)
```

By default the mouse over text is what is mapped in the aesthetics. You can add a `text` aesthetic to add this to the tooltip text. 

```{r,warning=F}
p2 <- p2+ geom_point(aes(text=Country))
gp2<-ggplotly(p2)
```

Interactive `plotly` graphics open in the *Viewer* pane in Rstudio and can be embedded in `R Markdown` documents. Alternatively you can save them as individual web pages using the `htmlwidgets` package:

```{r}
#View plotly
gp2
```

You can save plotly objects as html web pages:
```{r eval=F}
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(as_widget(gp2), "plotly_image.html")
```

<br>

### **Creating detailed graphics with ggpubr**

The **ggpubr** package provides wrapper functions for ggplot that make it easier to generate complex, publication ready graphics. It includes functions for running statistical tests and displaying the results in the plot. After using ggpubr, you will need to reset your theme with `theme_set()`.

```{r, warning=F}
# Violin plots with box plots inside
data("ToothGrowth")
df <- ToothGrowth

my_comparisons <- list( c("0.5", "1"), c("1", "2"), c("0.5", "2") )

ggviolin(df, x = "dose", y = "len", fill = "dose",
         palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
         add = "boxplot", add.params = list(fill = "white"))+
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, label = "p.signif")+ # Add significance levels
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 50)                                      # Add p-value 
```

The next example additionally uses the library **cowplot** to add density plots within the margins of the main figure. Don't worry if you get lost here, this is just a demonstration of what's possible in R and beyond the scope of this course.

```{r}
library(cowplot) 
# Main plot
pmain <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species))+
  geom_point()+
  ggpubr::color_palette("jco")
# Marginal densities along x axis
xdens <- axis_canvas(pmain, axis = "x")+
  geom_density(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species),
              alpha = 0.7, size = 0.2)+
  ggpubr::fill_palette("jco")
# Marginal densities along y axis
# Need to set coord_flip = TRUE, if you plan to use coord_flip()
ydens <- axis_canvas(pmain, axis = "y", coord_flip = TRUE)+
  geom_density(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species),
                alpha = 0.7, size = 0.2)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggpubr::fill_palette("jco")
p1 <- insert_xaxis_grob(pmain, xdens, grid::unit(.2, "null"), position = "top")
p2<- insert_yaxis_grob(p1, ydens, grid::unit(.2, "null"), position = "right")
ggdraw(p2)
```
